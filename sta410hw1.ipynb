    "# STA410 Programming Portfolio Assignment (25 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Point awards for assigning the correct values into variables are indicated along with each required variable assignment name.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Do not delete or replace cells**: this erases cell ids upon which automated scoring is based.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Cell ids are supported by [notebook format 4.5](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9729) or greater, and [jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org/install) version\n",
    "[3.0.13 or greater](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/releases/tag/v3.0.13). If the environment you work in does not support cell ids you will not get any credit for your submitted homework.  [UofT JupyterHub](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca) and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) support cell ids.\n",
    "      > You may check if cell ids are present or changing at each save with `! grep '\"id\":' <path/to/notebook>.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *You may add cells for scratch work*, but if required answers are not submitted through the provided cells where the answers are requested your answers will not be graded.\n",
    "    - *If you accidentally delete a required cell you can redownload the notebook* (so it has the correct required cells ids) and repopulate it with your answers (assuming you don't overwrite them).\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **No cells may have any runtime errors**: this causes subsequent tests to fail and you will not get credit for tests which fail because of previous runtime errors.\n",
    "    - The `try`-`except` block syntax \"catches\" runtime errors and transforms them into `exceptions` which are no longer runtime errors.  These `exceptions` will not cause subsequent tests to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No jupyter shortcut commands, e.g.,** `! python script.py 10` **may be used**: they will cause subsequent tests to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Specific code solutions submitted for these assignments must be created either individually or in the context of a paired effort.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Students may work individually.  \n",
    "    - Students choosing to work individually must work in accordance with the [University Student Academic Integrity values](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/academic-advising-and-support/student-academic-integrity)  of \"honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility and courage.\"\n",
    "  - Students may self-select pairs for each assignment.\n",
    "    - Paired students work together and may share work without restriction within their pair; but, must otherwise work in accordance with the [University Student Academic Integrity values](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/academic-advising-and-support/student-academic-integrity) noted above.\n",
    "    - Paired students each separately submit their (common) work, including (agreeing) contribution of work statements for each problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *Please seek homework partners in person or on the course discussion board on Quercus. Groups of three or more are not allowed; however, students are welcome to amicably seek new partners for each new assignment.* \n",
    "\n",
    "  ***Getting and sharing \"hints\" from other classmates is allowed; but, the eventual code creation work and submission must be your own individual or paired creation.***\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The homework is open book, open notes, open internet, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. You may use any functions available from all library imports below; otherwise, you are expected to create your own Python functionality based on the Python stdlib (standard libary)."
